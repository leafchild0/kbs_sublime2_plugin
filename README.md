This is plugin for highlighting a *.kbs syntax for Sublime2 text editor.

1) How to install it
2) How to use it
3) Current status of plugin

1) Need to clone repository and copy "KBS" folder in your Sublime2 plugins, which can be founded when you will try to create and save dummy plugin, using Tools -> New Plugin.
Path for Windows: C:\Users\userName\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages\User

After that just restart the editor.

2) Just install it and try to open any kbs file.

3) Still in development. Things TBD:

	- Add some small fixes into matching patterns via RegExp
	- Figure out how Sublime picks the colors
	- Add few snippets for kbs
	- Add smarter tags proceeding, can be copypasted from XML syntax plugin 


Thank you for using this.
